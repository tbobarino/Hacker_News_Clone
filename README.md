# Hacker_News_Clone

Rithm School Project to create a Hacker News clone.  The site takes the top stories using the Hacker News API, then uses a custom favorites API to log in and then create and save favorites, which can be accessed through the `Favorites` link.

Currently under construction, but can be viewed [here](https://tbobarino.github.io/Hacker_News_Clone/).
